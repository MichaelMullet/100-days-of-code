# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 24, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I publicly committed to the 100 Days of Code challenge, and learned CSS Flexbox fundamentals.

**Thoughts:** I decided this was the external motivation I needed to continue on my career transition into tech. I had a hard time focusing, but I pushed through and really got into Flexbox.


### Day 1: May 25, Tuesday

**Today's progress**: I learned CSS Grid fundamentals and finished the Responsive Web Design course from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** CSS Grid was interesting, and I could see myself using it frequently once I get into the habit. I just don't know how to apply it to a real project yet.


### Day 2: May 26, Wednesday

**Today's progress**: I started building a tribute page that meets freeCodeCamp requirements. I built the html and defined all the elements that I need, then started on CSS.

**Thoughts:** My first time applying everything I've learned! Not going to lie, it was disorienting trying to do it on my own. Lots of Googling and reviewing the [freeCodeCamp course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/)!


### Day 3: May 27, Thursday

**Today's progress**: I added the project to GitHub and integrated git version control. You can follow my progress [here](https://github.com/MichaelMullet/tributePage.git)! I also worked with layout and design, and changed the tribute content to be about my favorite coffee shop, Five Lakes Coffee. this is where I jumped from `starterPage.html` to `fiveLakesTribute.html`.

**Thoughts:** Getting proper layout was tough, and I tried to implement flexbox in my CSS. I might have to review flexbox and grid so I can properly implement them in my site.


### Day 4: May 29, Saturday

**Today's progress**: I worked with images and finished my first website today. First I learned how to host images on the web and upload them to my site, then I made them responsive to window sizes on the web page. I passed the codepen tests, so on to the next one!

**Thoughts:** I would have liked to work more with the design on this project, but it's memorial day weekend and I want to chill! Yesterday I was too busy with packing and life stuff to reach my computer. I just want my current project to pass for now, and when I'm not on vacation I can focus more on the design of a site.


### Day 5: June 1, Tuesday

**Today's progress**:  I took a few days off for memorial day weekend to spend with the family. I started a survey form website today, my goal is to make it fun and create my own design while still meeting the FreeCodeCamp requirements. I also started using external style sheets and got more comfortable with git commands in VSCode.

**Thoughts:** Even though the #100DaysofCode challenge discourages skipping days, I took a couple days off because 1. I needed the break and 2. I am looking for a more sustainable habit building tool. If I take days off every once in a while I will be refreshed enough to keep going for longer. I think that's a more realistic way of approaching this challenge while still trying to manage my busy schedule!


### Day 6: June 2, Wednesday

**Today's progress**: I learned and worked with html forms in my survey website. I used `text`, `number`, `radio`, and `checkbox` input types, as well as `select` and `textarea` fields to finish out the form.

**Thoughts**: I learned that building forms can be tedious, but the more accessable and easy to read, the better.


### Day 7: June 3, Thursday

**Today's progress**: I learned how to style form elements and started coming up with a design for my survey site.

**Thoughts**: It's much more difficult than I thought it would be to come up with a cohesive design for everything. You have to think of every detail!


### Day 8: June 4, Friday

**Today's progress**: I worked more on the design and focused on colors, fonts, and box shadows.

**Thoughts**: I only had an hour today but the time went very quickly! This is fun!
