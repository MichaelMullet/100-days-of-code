# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 24, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I publicly committed to the 100 Days of Code challenge, and learned CSS Flexbox fundamentals.

**Thoughts:** I decided this was the external motivation I needed to continue on my career transition into tech. I had a hard time focusing, but I pushed through and really got into Flexbox.


### Day 1: May 25, Tuesday

**Today's progress**: I learned CSS Grid fundamentals and finished the Responsive Web Design course from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** CSS Grid was interesting, and I could see myself using it frequently once I get into the habit. I just don't know how to apply it to a real project yet.


### Day 2: May 26, Wednesday

**Today's progress**: I started building a tribute page that meets freeCodeCamp requirements. I built the html and defined all the elements that I need, then started on CSS.

**Thoughts:** My first time applying everything I've learned! Not going to lie, it was disorienting trying to do it on my own. Lots of Googling and reviewing the [freeCodeCamp course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/)!

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
