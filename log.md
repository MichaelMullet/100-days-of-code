# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 24, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I publicly committed to the 100 Days of Code challenge, and learned CSS Flexbox fundamentals.

**Thoughts:** I decided this was the external motivation I needed to continue on my career transition into tech. I had a hard time focusing, but I pushed through and really got into Flexbox.


### Day 1: May 25, Tuesday

**Today's progress**: I learned CSS Grid fundamentals and finished the Responsive Web Design course from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** CSS Grid was interesting, and I could see myself using it frequently once I get into the habit. I just don't know how to apply it to a real project yet.


### Day 2: May 26, Wednesday

**Today's progress**: I started building a tribute page that meets freeCodeCamp requirements. I built the html and defined all the elements that I need, then started on CSS.

**Thoughts:** My first time applying everything I've learned! Not going to lie, it was disorienting trying to do it on my own. Lots of Googling and reviewing the [freeCodeCamp course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/)!


### Day 3: May 27, Thursday

**Today's progress**: I added the project to GitHub and integrated git version control. You can follow my progress [here](https://github.com/MichaelMullet/tributePage.git)! I also worked with layout and design, and changed the tribute content to be about my favorite coffee shop, Five Lakes Coffee. this is where I jumped from `starterPage.html` to `fiveLakesTribute.html`.

**Thoughts:** Getting proper layout was tough, and I tried to implement flexbox in my CSS. I might have to review flexbox and grid so I can properly implement them in my site.


### Day 4: May 29, Saturday

**Today's progress**: I worked with images and finished my first website today. First I learned how to host images on the web and upload them to my site, then I made them responsive to window sizes on the web page. I passed the codepen tests, so on to the next one!

**Thoughts:** I would have liked to work more with the design on this project, but it's memorial day weekend and I want to chill! Yesterday I was too busy with packing and life stuff to reach my computer. I just want my current project to pass for now, and when I'm not on vacation I can focus more on the design of a site.


### Day 5: June 1, Tuesday

**Today's progress**:  I took a few days off for memorial day weekend to spend with the family. I started a survey form website today, my goal is to make it fun and create my own design while still meeting the FreeCodeCamp requirements. I also started using external style sheets and got more comfortable with git commands in VSCode.

**Thoughts:** Even though the #100DaysofCode challenge discourages skipping days, I took a couple days off because 1. I needed the break and 2. I am looking for a more sustainable habit building tool. If I take days off every once in a while I will be refreshed enough to keep going for longer. I think that's a more realistic way of approaching this challenge while still trying to manage my busy schedule!


### Day 6: June 2, Wednesday

**Today's progress**: I learned and worked with html forms in my survey website. I used `text`, `number`, `radio`, and `checkbox` input types, as well as `select` and `textarea` fields to finish out the form.

**Thoughts**: I learned that building forms can be tedious, but the more accessable and easy to read, the better.


### Day 7: June 3, Thursday

**Today's progress**: I learned how to style form elements and started coming up with a design for my survey site.

**Thoughts**: It's much more difficult than I thought it would be to come up with a cohesive design for everything. You have to think of every detail!


### Day 8: June 4, Friday

**Today's progress**: I worked more on the design and focused on colors, fonts, and box shadows.

**Thoughts**: I only had an hour today but the time went very quickly! This is fun!


### Day 9: June 5, Saturday

**Today's progress**: I finished the first (and maybe only?) version of the design for my survey site. Here's how it looks! ![Survey site](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80130632/120908577-8e6ee580-c639-11eb-84df-f79dc3a9265c.png)

**Thoughts**: I like how the CodeCademy site looks so I wanted to borrow some design elements for my own page.


### Day 10: June 7, Monday

**Today's progress**: I practiced some Python to refresh my memory a bit and fixed an issue where my computer was not able to run Python from the terminal.

**Thoughts**: I caught a cold over the weekend and so my energy is sapped. I took yesterday off and today I wanted to do something more relaxed than usual.


### Day 11: June 8, Tuesday

**Today's progress**: I started the structure for a product landing page and did some planning for future projects.

**Thoughts**: Really busy today, didn't get to do as much as I wanted.


### Day 12: June 9, Wednesday

**Today's progress**: I sketched an outline of the product page and now have a product, business name, and page design in mind. Selling Nike shoes. &copy; 2021 Roadrunner, All Rights Reserved. 

**Thoughts**: I was inspired by the designs at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and [Allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com/).


### Day 13: June 11, Friday

**Today's progress**: Yes, I know I skipped another day. Work has been tough this week! Today I finished the structure and content of the product page. All I need is CSS styling!

**Thoughts**: Sometimes it's hard to start coding because I know I'll be sucked in for hours if I'm not careful.


### Day 14: June 13, Sunday

**Today's progress**: I made light visual improvements and designed a logo for the site.

**Thoughts**: I plan to go ahead with CSS in the coming days and work with flexbox for all of it. It has been tough to focus on coding recently, trying to balance everything in my schedule is hard.


### Day 15: June 17, Thursday

**Today's progress**: I took some more time off, which was great! However I have plans to wrap this FreeCodeCamp course soon, I miss Python. Today I "eased myself" back into the product page by working on the page layout. Yikes ðŸ˜…

**Thoughts**: I've been trying to take care of my mental health lately. In my mind, that is more important than burning myself out. When I get my energy back, I want to go all out on these projects.


### Day 16: June 18, Friday

**Today's progress**: Today was figuring out how to make a decent nav bar, and struggled more with page layout. Floats, divs, images, flexbox, and lists, oh my!

**Thoughts**: This is harder than I thought it would be. Hopefully I finish this soon so I can move on!
